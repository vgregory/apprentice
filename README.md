# apprentice

Python app project, intended to integrate ideas such as Notebooks, Articles, 
Flashcards, Spaced Repetition, etc, in order to enhance learning.

## Guidelines

### Notebooks

The idea of Notebooks derives from Microsoft OneNote. Something with the
following structure:
* Notebooks
  * Section Groups
    * Sections
      * Notes

### Articles

The idea of Articles derives from Wikipedia articles and should have somewhat 
the same appearance.

### Flashcards

The idea of Flashcards and Spaced Repetition comes from Anki. So the app should
be able to manage the scheduling and review of Flashcards, as well as store
some information about user's performance.

Flashcards should be related to some Note or some Article in order to review
related topic when the user desires.
